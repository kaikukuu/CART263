// Create three rectangles(or squares)
// The color, size, initial positions of the three rectangles do not matter: but USE VARS / CONSTS whenever possible
// Then: update the position of the 1st rectangle whenever the mouse is clicked on the canvas
// And: update the position of the 2nd rectangle when spacebar is pressed
// Finally: update the position of the 3rd rectangle in the draw()(each frame).Only change the y position in one direction.Also: handle the bottom canvas bounds: if the rectangle is at the bottom, set it to the top of the canvas
// BONUS: every time the mouse moves on the canvas change the color of the 3rd rectangle with a new random color
// For ALL parts: DO NOT USE OBJECTS or ARRAYS
// You can use IF STATEMENTS
