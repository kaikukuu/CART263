// Use a nested for loop to draw a grid of evenly spaced circles.
// Make the grid work for a circle size that is a multiple of 5(up to 100) - just by changing one variable.
// Make ALL circles the SAME random color - only switches on page reload
// Have this random color CHANGE for ALL CIRCLES when the user presses on space bar

// On mouse click change CIRCLES the to SQUARES if they were CIRCLES..AND to CIRCLES if they were SQUARES

// BONUS: ON LOAD: make every EVEN row CIRCLES and every ODD row SQUARES.
// Switch circles / squares on mouse click(odd row SQUARES and even row CIRCLES)..and vice versa
