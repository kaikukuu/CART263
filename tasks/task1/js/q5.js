// USE VARIABLES / CONSTS WHENEVER POSSIBLE
// FOR THIS EXERCISE DO NOT USE A FOR LOOP - ONLY WHILE LOOP(S)
// Create a variable that will hold a number i.e.counter, set its value to 0
// Create an orange square(width, size and position do not matter)
// Use an object to hold the square's properties (w,h,x and y and color)
// Create a function called displaySquare() and in the body of the function implement the code to render the orange square.Call this function in the draw()
// Whenever the mouse is clicked inside the orange square increment the counter variable by 1
// Whenever the mouse is over the orange square: highlight the square to be lighter orange
// Create a helper function to check if the mouse is inside the square(i.e.checkCollisionWithSquare()), and have it return true if it is and false otherwise.USE this function for the mouse click / over functionalities.
// Create an ellipse and draw it with its center at the center of the screen
// make a variable called radius to hold the size of the ellipse
// Set the color of the ellipse to be white
// Create a variable called ellipseAlpha to hold the alpha value of the ellipse.
// Practise showing the ellipse at different sizes - change the radius(always with the same x and y)
// USE A SINGLE WHILE LOOP in the draw() to draw the same number of ellipse as that of the counter(if the counter is 1 - 1 ellipse, if the counter is 2: 2 ellipse etc...)
// Also in the while loop: each new circle should be slightly larger and make the alpha value larger(start the alpha small)
// Do not draw anything if the counter is greater than 10 or less than 1
// BONUS: make the logic for drawing a single circle into a custom function (i.e.drawCircle(x, y, radius, alpha))
// BONUS II: make another square(red) that when clicked will decrement the counter by 1 ...AND - when hovered over will be lighter red ... (make custom functions and objects as required)
// BONUS III: INSTEAD OF USING A WHILE LOOP FOR THE ELLIPSE(S) - USE A FOR LOOP...
