// Create three rectangles: each one is the height of the canvas and 1 / 3 of the width of the canvas
// Position the first rectangle in the first third, the second in the second third and the third at the end of the canvas(three columns)
// Each rectangle should be a different blue color
// Then, IF / WHEN the mouse is over the 1st rectangle change the colour of the first rectangle to white
// Apply the same mouse behaviour to the other two rectangles
// Also: Implement the following; when /if the mouse is NOT over a given rectangle make sure that those rectangles go back to their original color
// For ALL parts: DO NOT USE ARRAYS
// You may use OBJECTS - but only for the color of the rectangles
